Translate the Python program composed of trading_band.py and xtrading_band.py to Fortran.
The Python program simulates trading policies with no-trade bands under proportional
transaction costs. Run the Python program to see the output and make the output
of the Fortran program as similar as possible.

Add brief comments within the main program and each
procedure explaining what they do. Format the comments so that the FORD
tool can produce documenation from them.

Use !! for documentation comments attached to the nearest code element
(module, submodule, procedure, variable) that precedes the comment
line.

Place !! comments on the same line as a declaration or on following
lines immediately after the declaration.

For multi-line doc blocks, start with !!* and then continue the block
with single-bang ! lines; they’ll be joined to the same doc block.

Assume that the gfortran compiler is installed. Use the compiler options
-O0 -Wall -Werror=unused-parameter -Werror=unused-variable -Werror=unused-function -Wno-maybe-uninitialized -Wno-surprising -fbounds-check -static -g -fmodule-private

Verify that program also compiles and runs with the ifx compiler using the options
/nologo /traceback /check:bounds /check:uninit /warn:all /warn:unused /gen-interfaces /warn:interfaces /F512000000

Create a batch file compile.bat that compiles the source files into executables using gfortran and ifx.

To check style, run fortitude check foo.f90 for each source file foo.f90 you create
after you verify that it compiles. Leave the executables created by the compilers in the
current directory.

Create a new git repository and commit source files to git once they
compile and run properly. Assume git commands are available.

Once the code is finished, use ford to create documentation from the comments
you have embedded in the code.

If any of python, gfortran, ifx, ford, fortitude, or git are unavailable, give an error message and quit.
